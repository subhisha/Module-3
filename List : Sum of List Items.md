# List Operations in Python: Sum of List Items

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that calculates the **sum of all elements** in a list.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Define a list of numbers.
2. Use Python’s built-in `sum()` function to calculate the total.
3. Print the result.

## 🧾 Program
```
L=[153,147,124,102] 
 
print(sum(L)))
```
